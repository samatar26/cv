![maze-logo](assets/maze_logo.png?raw=true)

### [Maze](https://maze.co) | Senior software engineer | Remote | Sep 2021 - Present
##### What is Maze and what am I building?
Maze is a rapid growing Series B startup building the future of product discovery for user-centric teams. We're powering product research for 60,000 customers worldwide including Uber, Accenture, FairMoney, and Braze. 

Maze empowers product teams to continuously collect and consume user insights across the entire product development cycle. With solutions for participant recruitment, product research, and reporting, Maze helps teams build the habit of continuous product discovery in a platform that enables everyone to run great research.

Tech: Typescript, Node.js, Neo4j, GraphQL, XState, Nest.js, Next.js, React, AWS, SNS/SQS, Nats, Terraform, CircleCi, OpenFGA

- Added a human touch to the product by allowing users to upload and set profile pictures while also syncing their gmail profile picture if they're authenticated through Google.
- Led and implemented our product's integration with a lifecycle marketing tool called [Iterable](https://iterable.com/). This helps the marketing team to guide users' journeys within the app from the moment they sign up.
- Championing the value of testing and helping the team upskill. Introduced [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and set up an entire test suite which is fast and reliable.
- Built a micro-frontend for the entire login/signup flow using Next.js and statemachines through XState to help us more easily run experiments.
- Gave users workspaces to effectively group their research projects including member access. The authorization model was built using [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev/)
- Giving free users a usage-based trial to allow them to explore all of the features that are offered on the Organization plans and have a taste of the real value of Maze. So far it's had a very positive impact on number of PQLs ðŸ“ˆ
- [Usage tracking](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mazedesign_introducing-usage-tracking-activity-7310692033021526018-Pbik?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACDrhtMBjdtlcGf_jN99ps9xjX_OY4uXz0c) using SNS/SQS allowing organizations to monitor their study and recruitment credit consumption which they can use to make strategic decisions and effectively plan their research budget.

### [Fluidly](https://fluidly.co.uk) | Software Engineer | Aug 2019 - Jul 2021

- Working in a mono-environment (production only, every commit to master/main goes directly to production). This results in extremely fast releases into production, requires very good monitoring and high quality code written exclusively using TDD.
- Working on Flask, FastAPI, and Node.js apps for the majority of our micro-services.
- Use of Postgres for our database and sqlalchemy to interact with the database. Familiar with speeding up slow queries, understanding query plans and different types of indexes from a B-tree index to a GIN index.
- Use of the **CQRS** approach to separate our logic of data changes from reading the data as the business logic of the system is quite complex (Accounting ðŸ˜µ). We used this together with **event-sourcing** and this made it really nice to see exactly what constitutes an update to a model. 
- Use React, TypeScript, Redux, Sass and Styled-Components to develop features for the app. React Testing Library and Cypress is used for the test-driven development of these features.
- Extensive knowledge and use of our infrastructure: CircleCI for our CI/CD pipeline, Google Cloud Platform for our cloud infrastructure and Terraform to manage all of our infrastructure.
- Introduced Domain Driven Design into our Node.js service. 
- Led on several payment platform integrations, including **Stripe**, **Chargebee** and **GoCardless**.
- Worked extensively on our data warehouse, using BigQuery and DBT. Also used Data Studio for reporting on user and connections base. First report I made resulted in the discovery of a bug in our OAuth implementation!
- Was part of the growth team to help increase our user base and also improve our retention. This involved a lot of experimenting and good use of analytics.
- Worked on and added VAT predictions to the app: The most requested feature by our users.
- Currently working on a permission system for our users.
